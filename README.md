Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project implements a machine learning classification model to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its physical measurements.
The model classifies flowers into:

Iris Setosa

Iris Versicolor

Iris Virginica

The project is developed as part of a Data Science Internship task.
